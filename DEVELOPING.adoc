== Installation

=== Install Java & Kotlin

You could use link:https://brew.sh/[Homebrew] to install on mac

[source,bash]
----
brew tap adoptopenjdk/openjdk
brew install adoptopenjdk8
brew install kotlin
----

OR The easiest way to install Java and Kotlin is to use link:https://sdkman.io/[SDK MAN]

Just open your terminal and enter:

[source,bash]
----
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
----

Follow the setup instructions and verify that your installation works:

[source,bash]
----
sdk version
----

If it shows you something like `5.11.5+713` then your good to continue.

Just install the mentioned dependencies:

[source,bash]
----
sdk install java 8.0.292.hs-adpt
sdk install kotlin 1.4.32
----

Check your installation by:

[source,bash]
----
java -version
kotlin -version
----

=== Android Studio

For better interop with iOS you may install the link:https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14936-kotlin-multiplatform-mobile[KMM plugin for Android Studio]. It let's you run, test and debug shared code on Android and iOS without switching the IDEs.

== Development Process

=== Features

Every change has to branch of from `main` and use this branch naming convention:

* `feature/{type_of_change}-{short_description}` or with ticket id `feature/{ticket_id}/{type_of_change}-{short_description}`

`main` must be always in releasable state.

==== Type Of Change

- *add* for new features or functionality
- *change* for changes in existing features or functionality
- *remove* | for removed features or functionality
- *fix* for any bug fixes
- *bump* for dependency updates
- *security* in case of vulnerabilities

Examples:

- `feature/SDK-456/add-awesome-hashing-algorithm`
- `feature/add-awesome-hashing-algorithm`
- `feature/remove-not-so-awesome-algorithm`
- `feature/fix-algorithm-corner-case`
- `feature/bump-lib-to-1.3.0`

== Release

A release branches of from `main` branch with following pattern:

* `release/{major}.{minor}(.{patch})/prepare-{major}.{minor}.{patch}` while patch is optional

Add following changes:

* Update CHANGELOG.adoc by creating a new Unreleased section and change current unreleased to release version
* Update README.adoc to release version
* Update the latest release badge link:assets/images/badges.adoc[HowTo]

Releases are automatically created when a tag in the form of `v{major}.{minor}.{patch}` is added.

== Develop

To build the iOS Example app, following steps need to be taken:

- Create the swift package from the KMP build by running the following command:

[source, terminal]
----
./gradlew createSwiftPackage
----

- Add an xcconfig file for the login configuration of the Core SDK in the `swift/` folder and name it `Data4LifeSDK.xcconfig`:
[source, terminal]
